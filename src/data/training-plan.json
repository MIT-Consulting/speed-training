  "program_title": "6 week field day program",
  "program_goal": "To enhance athletes speed, acceleration, change of direction/agility and movement proficiency.",
  "program_description": "This program was designed to be simple enough to follow for HS/College athletes training solo or with their team as well as for the general fitness seeker who still is looking to improve performance. The Field Day Program consists of 3 days. Day 1 is focused on Acceleration. Day 2 is focused on top end speed. Day 3 is focused on change of direction, lateral movements and agility. Each Day consists of a daily warm up, drills, plyometrics and then specific focused workouts to improve the focus of that day. In total, this program is 18 total days of workouts. This program progresses slowly each week as needed to build upon skill work and drills. The purpose of this is to expose athletes with a baseline of movement proficiency and gradually increase their skill through more difficult progressions. It is important to not skip steps. It is also important to note that NOT every week we will increase intensity or movement difficulty and that should be time spent on mastering a movement. If you feel you need to stick with a lesser advanced version, or repeat a week until you mastered a movement, please do so! Go at the pace that best suits you! The workouts + warm up are designed to take 30-45 minutes total. I advocate for you to take as much rest as you need after movements to feel fully fresh for each rep. The reason why is that while SPEED/AGILITY work should be done at max intensity and focus, the focus is NOT on excessive volume or tiring the athlete just for the sake of tiring the athlete. A lot of programs you see online labeled as speed/agility programs are actually conditioning workouts. This is where the field day program stands out! I want you to be fresh each rep so you can be fast! If you complete every drill, read the notes, and do each drill with intent, you will see improvements! It is recommended to NOT do this workout 3 days in a row and ideally you do it every other day such as MWF or T/Th/Sat. Be sure to watch all the mini demo videos beforehand as well.",
